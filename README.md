# Think about this

In 2018, Kesko had **18 931** tonnes of food waste. This correlates to **1.65%** of their annual sales figure. Based on financial data, grocery sales were **5.386 billion euros**, of which we can derive that the value of food going to waste is approximately **90 million euros** annually.  That is a lot of money, almost **1 billion euros** in **10 years** timeframe. We believe we can do better than that!

# K-Surprise

K-Surprise is a new business segment that sails in the blue ocean. What we have designed to do is quite simple. 

1. Customer places a food order through a platform.
2. We use data analytics to figure our **customer's preferences** and **previous purchases**
3. We can come up with recipes that the customer might like
4. **We then take real-time data from Kesko's stores and see which ingredients are on the verge of going to waste.**
5. We filter the possible recipes as per food waste reduced. 
6. This order is sent to the store, which then gathers the ingredients and prints the recipe on how to cook them
7. Kesko's K-transport is used to deliver the surprise! **Customers don't know what they'll get!**

# Kesko's API

The API that Kesko provided us actually works surprisingly well already. From that current database, we can derive the following information:

### Customer

- Customer-level
- RTM-quality: 
- RTM-easiness: 
- Previous purchases: 

### Recipe

- Ingredients
- Categories
- Prepare time
- Price

### Store

- Expiration dates
- Inventory level
- Location
- Market trends

Through our platform, be it then integrated to Kesko's application or stand on its own, we ask the customers to state their **allergies** and **diets**. It then comes down to asking the customer's **current desires** and the **order quantity**. By combining relevant information we can come up with the surprise recipe.
